# Numpy_operations

**NUMPY**

**NumPy** is a Python library widely used to handle arrays with arrays. 
Numpy can handle oversized, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical operations to operate on these arrays. 
It stands for numerical python. NumPy can provide an array object that is  50 times faster than traditional Python lists.


An array occupies less memory and is extremely convenient to use as compared to python lists.  
Additionally, it has a mechanism for specifying the data types. NumPy can operate on individual elements in the array without using loops and list comprehensions.



There are two ways to create NumPy arrays:

**1.** By converting the existing lists or tuples to arrays using np.array

**2.** By initializing fixed-length arrays using the Numpy functions.

I have done the basic operatons in numpy such as,

creating an array of 1D,2D etc

creating an array using fucntiona such as random,arange,linspace,ect.

And I have done some Matrix Operations such as concanting arrays, taking inverse and transpose and determinant ,dot or inner product and Array indexing and Slicing.
